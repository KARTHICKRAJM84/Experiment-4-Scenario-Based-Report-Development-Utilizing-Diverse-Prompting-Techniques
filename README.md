# Aim:
To create a comprehensive report for the design of a specific application, such as AI-powered 
chatbot/solar panel system/automation in manufacturing, using diverse prompt patterns. This 
report will employ scenario-based prompting techniques to guide each stage of the design process, 
ensuring the solution meets the functional and user experience requirements for the chosen 
application.
# Procedure:
1. Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Outline the purpose of the design, the target audience or user base, and its main objectives. 
Specify the goals the design aims to fulfill, such as user engagement/energy efficiency/task 
automation.
2. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Select appropriate prompt patterns to guide different aspects of the design. Examples of 
prompt patterns and their applications in the report include:
○ Idea Generation Prompts: Brainstorm innovative features or functions the design 
should incorporate to meet specific goals.
○ Persona and Context Prompts: Define the tone, style, or experience the design 
should convey (e.g., user-friendly/sustainable/reliable), aligning with the intended 
audience.
○ Exploratory Prompts: Investigate resources or information essential for the design, 
such as user needs/environmental constraints/technical requirements.
○ Refinement Prompts: Refine design elements by adjusting specifications, materials, 
or style to meet project standards.
○ Scenario Testing Prompts: Simulate realistic scenarios or use cases to test the 
design’s effectiveness and adaptability in user interaction/environmental 
settings/production workflows.
○ Error Handling Prompts: Design prompts to handle potential issues or challenges 
effectively within the user interface/system functionality/automation processes.
3. Implementation Plan:
Describe the steps to build and implement the design, from system 
configuration/component selection/automation setup to testing and 
deployment/installation/integration.
4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection:
Use targeted feedback prompts to gather insights from users/stakeholders/operators, 
refining the design based on their input for improved functionality and alignment with 
objectives.
5. Documentation of Findings:
Summarize insights from each prompting technique, noting how they enhanced the design. 
Include any best practices, limitations, or future improvements.

1. Define the Scenario and Use Case
Purpose:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that streamlines access to university resources, enhances 
communication, and improves student and staff productivity. 
Target Audience: 
 Primary Users: Students seeking academic, administrative, or campus-related support. 
 Secondary Users: Faculty and administrative staff requiring quick access to information or routine 
process automation. 
Objectives:
 1. Provide 24/7 support for frequently asked questions and university services. 
 2. Enable seamless navigation of academic resources (e.g., class schedules, course materials). 
 3. Improve user engagement with a conversational and user-friendly interface. 
 4. Automate repetitive administrative tasks like leave applications, feedback collection, and 
reminders.
2. Prompt Pattern Applied: Idea Generation Prompts
Objective:
To brainstorm innovative features and functions the chatbot should incorporate to meet the design 
objectives effectively.
Prompt Example 1: 
"What features can enhance the chatbot's ability to support students academically and 
administratively?"
Generated Ideas: 
 1. Academic Features: 
 - Personalized course suggestions based on student profiles and interests. 
 - Real-time updates on class schedules, deadlines, and exam dates. 
 - A digital assistant to help with assignment tracking and study schedules. 

 2. Administrative Features:
 - A leave application and approval system for students and faculty. 
 - Campus event notifications and RSVP management. 
 - Instant access to university policies, procedures, and directories. 
Prompt Example 2: 
"How can the chatbot be more engaging and accessible for a diverse user base?" 
Generated Ideas:
 1. Multilingual support for international students. 
 2. Voice-enabled interactions for hands-free usage. 
 3. Gamification features, such as badges or rewards for completing tasks (e.g., attending events or 
meeting deadlines). 
3. Implementation Plan
1. System Configuration:
 - Choose a robust NLP platform such as Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, or Rasa to develop 
conversational capabilities. 
 - Integrate the chatbot with the university's existing databases and systems for real-time updates. 
2. Feature Development: 
 - Build modules for core functions: scheduling, reminders, academic assistance, and administrative 
automation. 
 - Incorporate machine learning for personalized recommendations. 
 - Enable multilingual support using pre-trained language models. 
3. Testing and Deployment: 
 - Conduct usability testing with focus groups of students and staff. 
 - Deploy a beta version to gather early feedback and fine-tune features. 
4. Maintenance and Iterative Improvement: 

 - Regularly update the chatbot’s knowledge base with new information. 
 - Monitor performance metrics like response accuracy and user satisfaction to guide 
improvements. 
4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection
Targeted Feedback Prompts:
Prompt Example 1:
 "On a scale of 1-5, how well does the chatbot provide accurate and timely responses to your 
queries?"
 - Insights: Most users rated 4 or 5 but suggested improving response time for complex queries. 
Prompt Example 2:
 "What additional features would you like the chatbot to have?"
 - Insights: Users requested integration with the library system and job placement portal. 
5. Deliverables
A. Prototype: 
- A functional chatbot with the following features: 
 1. Academic Assistance: Personalized schedules, reminders, and assignment tracking. 
 2. Administrative Support: Automated forms, campus notifications, and FAQs. 
 3. Multilingual and Voice Support: Accessibility for diverse users. 
B. Prompt Effectiveness Summary:
-Impact of Idea Generation Prompts:
 - Allowed creative brainstorming of features that directly addressed user needs. 
 - Multilingual support and gamification were identified as key differentiators. 
C. User Testing Results:-
- Positive Feedback: High satisfaction with scheduling and reminder features. 

# Improvement Areas: 
 - Enhanced personalization for diverse academic needs. 
 - Faster integration of external resources like the library and placement portals. 
D. Improvement Plan:
1. Integrate requested features like library assistance. 
2. Use feedback loops for continuous refinement and user-centric updates. 
# Conclusion 
The Idea Generation Prompt technique played a pivotal role in designing a user-friendly and 
innovative chatbot for university assistance. By systematically addressing user needs, the chatbot 
prototype aligns with both functional and experiential objectives, ensuring robust support for the 
university community.
